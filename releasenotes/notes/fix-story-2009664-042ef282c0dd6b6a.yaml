    Fixed Story 2009664 - Fixed the Consumer controller to be able to use the
    associated Container's ownership information in policy checks.

    Part of the fix for Story 2009664 required renaming the policy for
    Container Consumers from "consumers:get" to "container_consumers:get",
    "consumers:post" to "container_consumers:post", and "consumers:delete"
    to "container_consumers:delete".  If you are using custom policies to
    override the default policies you will need to update them to use the
    new names.
