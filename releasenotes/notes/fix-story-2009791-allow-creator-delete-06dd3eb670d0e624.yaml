    Fixed Story #2009791: Users with the "creator" role on a project can now
    delete secrets owned by the project even if the user is different than
    the user that originally created the secret.  Previous to this fix a user
    with the "creator" role was only allowed to delete a secret owned by the
    project if they were also the same user that originally created, which
    was inconsistent with the way that deletes are handled by other OpenStack
    projects that integrate with Barbican.  This change does not affect private
    secrets (i.e. secrets with the "project-access" flag set to "false").
